# Expense Reimbursement System
## Project Description
An expense reimbursement system which targets two different types of users. A valid employee can log in and visit their dashboard to see their pending reimbursement tickets or have the ability to post another reimbursement ticket. The other user is a finance manager that can log in and view all past reimbursement tickets posted by any "employee" users. The finance managers are able to approve or deny an employee's request depending on if the expense was incurred while on company time.
